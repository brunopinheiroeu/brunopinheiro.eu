This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Development workflow

Content is now hosted in **Contentful**, so only the Next.js server needs to run
locally.

```bash
npm install          # first run only
npm run dev          # or yarn dev / pnpm dev / bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.

### Environment variables

Create `frontend/.env.local` with the Contentful credentials:

```bash
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=xxxxxxxx
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx
# Optional: enables draft previews when we add preview routes
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx
```

See [`CONTENTFUL_SETUP.md`](./CONTENTFUL_SETUP.md) for the exact content model
and entry requirements.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
